                    <p>Michael Roy is a full-time student in their first year of the Multimedia Production Program
                        at Lethbridge College. He is interested in becoming a full-time Graphic Designer and Content
                        Creator. Michael was born in Kamloops, BC and in 2003 moved to Calgary, AB with his family.
                        Following this in 2008 he moved to Lethbridge and has lived in the city for 14 years.
                        Michael started attending Chinook High School in 2015 where he joined into CTS courses and
                        begun his journey learning the Adobe Creative Suite.

                        Michael's most important inspirations in his life are his parents, as they have always been his
                        biggest supporters. Throughout high school they supported his journey through his artwork and
                        developments. His father has taught him many skills, of which he uses on many occasions, with
                        knowledge in plumbing, woodworking, electrical work and drywalling. His mother taught him how to
                        cook, bake, from her he also learned sewing from her which has come in handy on more than one
                        occasion.

                    <p> Michael's passions extend into many different mediums. Early on he took up an interest in art,
                        and began to excel at it. Drawing in sketchbooks and creating recreations were some of his first
                        interests. Following his time in high school he began to studying in the Adobe Creative Suite.
                        With programs like Illustrator and Photoshop, Michael's artwork took a digitial turn. Creating
                        artworks of characters from recent pop culture icons, Michael often works on anime character
                        artwork as well as comic book characters. Some of his artworks featured here include Cyberpunk:
                        Edgerunners, Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse, Clone Force 99 from the Bad Batch and Avatar
                        The Last Airbender. Recently Michael has taken up an interest in Cosplay, and has now made his
                        own Mandalorian Armour and CT-9904 Crosshair</p>

                <div class="col-sm-4 text-white">
                    <p>Two of Michael's most accomplished projects to date have been his cosplay's of CT-9904 Crosshair
                        from the Bad Batch. Alongside a custom Mandalorian kit, both sets of armour are 3D Printed and
                        Painted with both spray paint and acrylic paint. Both of the suits are the product of over 2
                        months of work for each with constant additions and fixes being done to improve the suits. The
                        cosplay's are a large part of Michael's identity and he takes immense pride in the construction
                        of each one.</p>
